# Random Coffee

Place a file `users.txt` in the directory where the executable lives and populate it with the users that participate in
the random coffee.

Example input:

```bash
> cat ./users.txt
Pietje Puk
Jan Klaasen
Katrien Duck
Mr Sandman
Rens van Leeuwen
```

Running the program:

```bash
> ./random-coffee
Katrien Duck ↔ Mr Sandman
  Pietje Puk ↔ Rens van Leeuwen
 Jan Klaasen ↔ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

User Jan Klaasen has no one to drink coffee with
